                  <p> Tuition, tuition, tuition. Really what it is, is money that you have to use to pay for going to college. Over the years tuition has greatly increased due to inflation of the college business and has become much harder for many people to afford a college education. It has become a deciding factor for many students about which colleges to go to and considering the long term amount that needs to be paid, it has also chosen which careers students can go into. The most expensive colleges tend to be the institutions with bachelor's degree and higher level education especially private institutions. Public institutions tend to be cheaper due to federal and state provisions but they also have their weaknesses as well. Community college, certificate programs, and two-year colleges tend to be the cheapest option as they have funding from the government along with focused curriculums and plans which require less money than the average big instituition. That being said, there is financial aid, scholarships, and many other options available for a student coming into college as they pursue their dream career.</p>

                  <p> Many students considering a bachelor's degree may have the option between a public or private institution. The most obvious difference between the two is definitely the tuition. Private colleges even though they may be more expensive, can have their own benefits. Class sizes tend to be smaller, the faculty tends to put more focus on the students, and it is easier to create important and meaningful connections. However, with that being said, it really is about affordability. If you think you can not afford the private institution, then it may be better to go to the public university. Even though the class sizes are much bigger and the faculty have much more responsibilities, the campus tends to have more opportunities for students and have greater connections with other programs. The choice all comes down to what you value the most and what your budget is.</p>

                <div style="width:1010px;height:190px;background-color:white;display:inline-block;text-align:center;">
                  <p> The best and free way to get college tuition covered is financial aid. This is money given by the federal government to students to use for their education without the worry of needing to pay it back. The money given by the federal government does use different scales such as family income, location, and other factors about you to figure out how much you will be given but even if you think you are out of this "scale", you should still apply for it. We have seen many students still able to receive financial aid even with their wealthy background. This money may come in the form of grants or scholarships given by the state. The most important thing to note is that in order to receive any of this money, you <strong>must complete the FAFSA</strong> which is a form that links tax information and other pieces of information to an online system so the federal government can decide how much you will earn.</p>

                  <p> Another free way to receive money to pay for college tution or other needs are scholarships. <strong>Scholarships</strong> are financial aid which are awarded to students based on different criteria. These scholarships can be given out by institutions, businesses, markets, or even an individual as long as there is some method of competition in receiving it. Now while it may require a little more effort to receive scholarships such as writing essays, creating videos, or other forms of competition, scholarships can go a long way in helping to pay for college over a long period of time. While most scholarships are awarded to the college that the awardee is attending, <strong>grants</strong> are usually given directly to the student. To learn more about scholarships, feel free to ask the financial aid office at your college or check some of these websites which have links to different scholarships available.</p>

                <p> Unlike the other options listed before, <strong>loans</strong> are not free and must be repayed within a certain period of time. Now while this option may not be preferred, it allows students to have a lot of costs be covered during their time in college so it is easier to focus on their studies and worry about paying that money later once they have a stable career. Since loans do come from banks or the federal government, they have an interest rate attached to them so the banks can make money off these loans. Federal loans tend to be better as they have <strong>fixed rates</strong>, which are interest rates that do not change over time, and the rate tends to be lower as well. With bank loans, the <strong>variable rate</strong> may be favored if the loan is a long time payment or a huge amount as the market change can bring the interest rates down (but be aware it can always inflate as well!). No matter what type of loan you get, your credit score is the determining factor for many aspects of a loan. So it is always good to open a credit card account and periodically using it while paying bills on time to build your credit score in order to bring down rates and get a reasonable amount for your loan.</p>

                  <p> Working in college is another method to pay off tuition or other expenses that come from attending college. <strong>Work-study jobs</strong> are jobs that are given to students who express financial need and a specific college job is allocated to them based on their class schedule. All the money that they do receive has the option of going to pay off their tuition or going to them directly. Colleges also do offer <strong>non work-study jobs</strong> which are just normal jobs that students can apply for and are given money directly to the students. Most of these jobs that are offered by the colleges can be learned about through the financial aid office or the financial aid advisor appointed to you when accepted into college. Another option may be to find a <strong>part-time or seasonal job</strong> that can work with your schedule to make money on the side. While this option may take some time management skills to organize your schedule, it's an option which allows you to work on your own time where available positions will vary based on the location, work experience, and qualities that you have.</p>
