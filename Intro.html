            <p> A <strong>four-year college</strong> is a university or college that provides a standard four year program outline so that students can receive a bachelor's degree. You do not have to finish in exactly four years, the student has the option to take less or more time then four years in order to gain a bachelor's degree. Now you may be wondering, why are they only focusing on a bachelor's degree? A <strong> bachelor's degree </strong> is the degree that gives you the most options when it comes to choosing a future career. By gaining a bachelor's degree, you have the option of working many types of jobs that require or recommend to have certain degrees, apply for graduate school to continue education to become more advanced careers or even use that degree to teach subjects that you've mastered in. While there are many types of options for what degree you can get such as an associate's degree or a certificate, a bachelor's degree gives you job security and stability while giving you the most amount of options for what you want to do in life.</p>
