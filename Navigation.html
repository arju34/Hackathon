              <strong>Location</strong> - is a very important factor in considering in which college you should go to. Luckily we have made that easier for you by organizing all four-year institutions into their respective states and telling you their exact address. All you have to do is use the Navigation bar to pick the state you want to explore.

              <strong>Factors</strong> - After condensing the list down to which colleges are viable for you based on location, you can then focus on the factors for each college. What major are you going for? IS tuition a big factor in deciding which college you go to? How about where you live or living costs? All of those factors we have put into the Navigation bar so you can easily click and figure out what you need to do!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document</strong> - It is now time to organize and document all the factors of every college you are interested in going to. You can find out what each of those factors are such as the tuition, cost of living, or other things through the college's home page which is linked to every college we have listed. Using this excel sheet, you can document those factors and condense the list down to the colleges that best suit you!
